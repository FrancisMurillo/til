Here's what you may have missed in frontend development in the past 3 years.

### Node.js

All frontend tooling is done in Node.js. Here's what's new

  - Node.js v6
  - Yarn

### ES2015+

### A+ tier

Gold standard of "what's hot right now?"

  - Babel
  - Webpack
  - PostCSS / CSSnext
  - React
  - Vue

### A tier

Not "hotness" level, but still in very good rotation

  - Bootstrap
  - Sass
  - Browserify
  - Typescript
  - jQuery

### B tier

Things that may be slipping out of fashion

  - Gulp, Grunt
  - CoffeeScript
  - Polymer, Ember, Angular
  - Less
  - Autoprefixer (see: cssnext)
  - Require.js
  - Rollup (see: webpack 2)
